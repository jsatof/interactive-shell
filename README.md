# Shell Terminal Project
This project implements a linux-like terminal with the base functionalities, including `pwd`, `cd`, `mkdir`, `rmdir`, `chmod`, `cp`.

The `headers` directory contains all created header files for more organization. 

The terminal itself is launched by the `NautonShell` file.

# Use
<p>
	The shell is launched by entering: `./NautonShell`
	Then shell will await input from user and parses for the listed commands: `@USER> <command> <arguments>`
	An error message will be returned if something other than the listed commands are entered.
