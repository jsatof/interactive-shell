# Shell Terminal Project
This project implements a linux-like terminal with the base functionalities, including `pwd`, `cd`, `mkdir`, `rmdir`, `chmod`, `cp`.<br>
The `headers` directory contains all created header files for more organization. <br>
The terminal itself is launched by the `NautonShell` file.<br>

# Use
The shell is started by entering: `./NautonShell`<br>
Then shell will await input from user and parses for the listed commands: `@USER> <command> <arguments>`<br>
An error message will be returned if something other than the listed commands are entered.
